# Machine Learning - Principal Component Analysis

Classify real estate using principal component analysis with three different features, Module ml@FHNW.

## Getting Started

The following instructions are intended to help you get the MATLAB project up and running.

### Documentation

The results are summarized in the pdf-file *excercise_2.pdf*. The corrsponding sources can be found in the respective matlab-scripts.

### Prerequisites

The main script was developed and tested as a MATLAB live script. A MATLAB version supporting live scripts must be used.

### Run scripts

The code can be executed by running the *excercise_2.mlx* script as a MATLAB live script. Running the entire script may take some time, as explorative analyses for some excercises go through a large number of iterations.
